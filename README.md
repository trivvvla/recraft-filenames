## About

`recraft-filename` is a Python-based utility designed to improve the organization and consistency of music files within a specified directory. This tool ensures that filenames adhere to certain standards and conventions, removes unwanted characters, and makes the entire collection easier to navigate and manage.

## Features

- **Remove Multiple Spaces**: Identifies and fixes filenames with multiple consecutive spaces.
- **Remove Brackets**: Removes content within square brackets in filenames.
- **Check and Fix Special Characters**: Checks filenames for special characters and fixes them.
- **Replace Characters**: Specifically replaces em dashes in filenames.
- **Dynamic Main Menu**: Lists and executes available features dynamically.
- **Consistent User Interaction**: Uses external libraries like `tabulate` and `termcolor` for a uniform output across features.
